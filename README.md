Advent of Code solutions in Javascript, with tests!

## Running
`npm install`, and then `cd` into the folder of choice, using either `babel-node run` (for the answer) or `mocha test` (to run the tests). This is my first time with tests, so inevitably I'll do something so wrong that it'll make your eyes bleed. Wear goggles!
