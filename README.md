Advent of Code solutions in Javascript, with tests!

## Running
1. `npm install`
2. `cd` into the folder of choice
 1. `node run` for the answer
 2. `mocha` to run the tests

This is my first time with tests, so inevitably I'll do something so wrong that it'll make your eyes bleed. Wear goggles! But seriously, tell me if there's even the slighest of problems, so that I can improve!

## Why
Tests might be a bit overkill, but this is a perfect opportunity for me to learn more about Mocha and node enviroments. I also try to keep clean code standards, but I'm not really sure what they are, so the code will probably end up looking terrible anyway.
